## 📁 Introduction
This project involved building an interactive Excel dashboard using a healthcare dataset provided by **Evergreen Digital Tech Solution**. The aim was to analyze patient demographics, health conditions, and admission trends while transforming raw data into actionable business insights. The final dashboard supports quick decision-making and data exploration via a user-friendly interface.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations often face challenges in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions due to the volume and complexity of patient data. The objective of this project was to:
- Summarize and visualize key patient metrics.
- Identify trends in health status and financial profiles.
- Explore demographic and behavioral patterns.
- Enable dynamic exploration through interactivity.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked
- **Total Records**: Total number of patient entries.
- **Average Age**: Mean age of all patients.
- **Average Salary**: Mean income level of the patient pool.
- **Health Condition Distribution**: Health status categorized as Excellent, Good, Average, Poor, or Not Specified.
- **Education Level vs. Credit Score**: Analysis of education attainment in relation to creditworthiness.
- **Age Group Distribution**: Patient segmentation across age bands.
- **City-wise Admission Count**: Proportional representation of patient admissions by city.
- **Monthly Admission Trend**: Seasonal trend of admissions over time.

## 🔍 Analysis & Insights
- **Health Conditions**: The majority of patients were in “Good” health, with noticeable proportions in “Excellent” and “Poor” categories.
- **Education vs Credit Score**: Patients with Master’s degrees had the highest average credit scores, followed by Bachelor’s and High School graduates.
- **Age Groups**: The 21–40 age range had the highest number of admissions, indicating higher healthcare utilization among young adults.
- **City Distribution**: One city dominated the admission count, suggesting it may serve as a regional hub or have more healthcare access.
- **Monthly Trends**: Admissions peaked at the start of the year and mid-year, hinting at seasonal or operational factors.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- 📌 **Target Preventive Health Measures** for patients in “Poor” and “Average” health to reduce future admissions.
- 📌 **Develop Financial Literacy Programs** tailored to patients with lower education and credit scores.
- 📌 **Reallocate Resources Strategically** in cities with higher admission volumes.
- 📌 **Investigate Admission Peaks** to understand and mitigate seasonal surges or resource strain.

## 📌 Conclusion
This dashboard effectively showcases how Excel can be used to turn raw healthcare data into an insightful, interactive, and user-friendly decision support tool. It combines core data analysis principles with powerful visualization to guide healthcare providers and analysts toward better operational and clinical outcomes.
